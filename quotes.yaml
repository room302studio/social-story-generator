        text: "Send us the pitch everyone else said no to. The dataset that makes no sense. The prototype that sounds impossible. The integration everyone said couldn't be done. We live for this stuff. Our Discord is full of people building things that shouldn't exist - AI assistants that post philosophy at 3am, mesh networks that run in forests, data visualizations that make hardened executives cry. Your strangest idea is probably Tuesday for us. But here's the thing: we don't just build it and bounce. We teach you how we did it. We document every decision. We livestream the tricky parts. Because the goal isn't just to solve your problem - it's to expand what you think is possible."
      - title: "The Anti-Agency Agency"
        text: "We've turned down venture capital three times. Not because we're precious about it, but because we've seen what happens when studios scale wrong. They hire account managers who've never written code. They add layers between you and the builders. They stop livestreaming because 'proprietary methods.' They stop caring. So we stay small. We stay weird. We keep our Discord free and our process transparent. We work with clients who get it - who understand that four people who genuinely care will outperform forty who are just collecting paychecks. If you want someone who'll tell you what you want to hear, hire McKinsey. If you want someone who'll build something worth remembering, email us."
      - title: "From Prototype to Poetry"
        text: "Every project starts the same way: you send us an email. Maybe it's a paragraph, maybe it's a novel. We read everything. We respond to humans. Then we talk - not a sales call, just humans discussing what's possible. If it feels right, we start building. Maybe it's a two-week prototype that proves your impossible idea. Maybe it's a six-month journey that transforms how your organization thinks about data. Either way, you're getting our full attention. Speed Demon at his fastest. Sarah architecting systems that sing. Our AI assistant remembering every detail. Jazz in the background, quality in the foreground. And when we ship? It's not just functional. It's joyful. It's documented. It's yours to build on forever."

        text: "Everyone's building AI that wants to eat the world. We're building AI that remembers your birthday and helps debug your existential crisis. The future doesn't need more surveillance capitalism - it needs systems with soul. Code that cares. Infrastructure that nurtures. We're not trying to disrupt anything. We're trying to heal the relationship between humans and machines. One Observable notebook at a time. One livestream at a time. One weird project that makes someone say 'holy shit, I didn't know technology could feel like this' at a time. Join us. The water's warm and the vibes are immaculate."

Processes that feel like play. Teams that actually want to show up. We'll teach your engineers to code like they're composing symphonies. We'll show your data scientists how to make visualizations that make the C-suite weep with understanding. We'll build you an AI that doesn't feel like HAL 9000's boring cousin. Most importantly? We'll remind everyone why they got into tech in the first place. Before the burnout. Before the meetings about meetings. When it was just you, a computer, and infinite possibility."

        text: "You've been thinking about that project for months. The one that would change everything if it worked. The one your current vendor says is 'out of scope.' The one that keeps you up at night because you can feel how cool it could be. This is your sign to build it. With people who get it. Who won't talk you out of the ambitious parts. Who livestream the hard parts so you learn too. Who celebrate when it works and debug with you when it doesn't. Stop waiting for permission. Stop shrinking your vision to fit someone else's invoice template. Email us your biggest, wildest, most ambitious idea. Let's make something worth writing home about."

        text: "Here's what happens: You hire us for that impossible project. We build it in public, teaching your team along the way. It ships on time, under budget, and it actually works. Your boss thinks you're a visionary. Your team thinks you're a hero. The board thinks you deserve a raise. But here's the secret - you were always a genius. You just needed a team that could see it too. That could take your wild idea and make it real without dumbing it down. That's what we do. We're genius amplifiers. Vision enablers. Dream builders. And we do it all while jamming to Coltrane and arguing about whether to deploy on Friday."
      - title: "Free Therapy With Every Sprint"
        text: "Other studios give you status reports. We give you status reports AND help you process your complicated feelings about late-stage capitalism. Our standups include existential check-ins. Our retrospectives double as group therapy. Our AI assistant is trained in both JavaScript and Jung. Because let's be real - building technology in 2024 is emotional labor. Might as well work with people who acknowledge that. Who make space for both your brilliant ideas and your Tuesday afternoon breakdown. Who understand that the best code comes from humans who feel seen, heard, and caffeinated."

You've open-sourced parts of it because you're not afraid of competition anymore. You know what makes you special can't be copied. You're already planning the next project with us. Not because you need us - you don't anymore. But because building cool shit with people who care is addictive. And we're really good dealers."

We build the confidence to present those slides without notes. Most importantly, we build them with you, not for you. So when they ask how you did it, you can honestly say 'we built this.'

No pivots mid-project unless you ask for them. No 'interesting challenges' that mean we're lost. Just solid execution from people who've been shipping code since CSS was optional.

When to go full WebGL. When to just use CSS and call it a day. We don't have a hammer looking for nails. We have a complete workshop and the experience to know which tool solves your actual problem. Plus the taste to make it beautiful."
      - title: "Notebooks That Teach"
        text: "Our Observable notebooks don't just show data - they teach people how to think about it. Interactive tutorials built into the visualization. Sliders that explain themselves. Code that invites tinkering. By the time your team is done playing with what we built, they understand not just what the data says, but why it matters and how to ask better questions. That's not a deliverable. That's transformation."
