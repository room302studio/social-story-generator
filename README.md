## üß† Quote Categories That Actually Hit

The quotes span 16 themes that capture the full Room 302 Studio energy:

- **Neurodivergent Genius** - "Our brains just hit different and that's the whole point"
- **Hacker Philosophy** - "Every system has cheat codes. Your job is finding them"
- **Rapid Prototyping** - "Ship it messy, patch it live, glow up forever"
- **Creative Process** - "Make it work first, make it pretty later"
- **Building in Public** - "Post your ugly drafts. Vulnerability is the vibe"

## üõ† How It Works

1. **Parse Quotes**: Loads structured quotes from Markdown with titles and body text
2. **Template Processing**: Uses JSDOM to manipulate SVG text elements
3. **Smart Text Distribution**: Distributes words across existing tspan elements for perfect wrapping
4. **Procedural Art Generation**: Creates unique constellations using Chance.js seeded randomness
5. **Mathematical Positioning**: Golden ratio and baseline grid alignment for invisible precision
6. **NLP Processing**: Uses compromise.js to identify key words for star formation
7. **Rare Effects**: 0.3% chance glitch-canvas effects for subtle digital texture
8. **Format Detection**: Reads viewBox to determine export dimensions
9. **PNG Export**: Uses Sharp for high-quality image rendering

### Advanced Features

- **`--ae` flag**: Exports clean SVG files for After Effects motion graphics
- **Deterministic Randomness**: Same quote always generates same constellation
- **Crypto Steganography**: Hidden coordinate encoding (when enabled)
- **Square Format Enhancements**: Constellation lines connect to text anchor points

## üé≠ Design Philosophy

Inspired by the 2011 visual.ly technique of using D3 and Illustrator groups, but modernized for batch processing. The approach prioritizes:

- **Minimal Code**: As little code as possible
- **Elegant Solutions**: Simple text replacement over complex DOM manipulation
- **Batch Efficiency**: Generate hundreds of images quickly
- **Design Consistency**: Templates maintain visual brand coherence
